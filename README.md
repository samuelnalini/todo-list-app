# Todo List App
The classic starter project of any student.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
This is made to run on Linux, but really any machine should be able to compile and run it.
Just run the "main" binary and follow the REPL instructions.

### NOTES:
I learned a lot from this project, including:
  - Creating a REPL
  - User input handling
  - File handling - I/O
  - Error handling
