# Todo List App

## ABOUT:
A simple application that allows users to add and remove tasks, as well as modify a task's state. It offers persistence with configurable save paths through a configuration file.

I do plan on updating this project and adding to it in the future.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
This is made to run on Linux, but really any machine should be able to compile and run it.

If you'd like to change the name of the binary when it's created you can simply edit the Makefile's target

### RUNNING:

You can create the binary by running `make` and then executing it by running it as any other binary
`./app`

A configuration path can be specified when running the binary
`./app <PATH>`


### NOTES:

*This is one of my early projects designed to help me learn C++ through project building.*

I learned a lot from this experience, including:
  - Creating a REPL
  - User input
  - File handling - I/O
  - Error handling
  - Makefiles
  - And more

*There will be a remade version in C coming soon*
